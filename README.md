# Employee Management System

Usually, large companies and organizations have a vast army of human resources working under them. In such scenarios where there’s a significant number of human employees to manage, it becomes challenging to supervise and manage the activities of the human resources efficiently. Such companies/organizations need an advanced employee management system that can handle everything related to the company’s human resources.

This project aims to build an employee management system that consolidates all the relevant information on a company’s human resources. It has two major components – Admin and Employee. The Admin is in charge of the company information, leave management and payroll, and can also add and tweak employee details. Likewise, employees can use the system to check their leave status, view salary details, yearly holiday list, and also for voicing grievances or resigning. This can be one of the final year project ideas for IT students.
